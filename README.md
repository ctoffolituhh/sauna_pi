# sauna_pi

raspberry pi code for controlling a peltier element with a mosfet switch and a ds18b20 and a dht22 temperature sensors

the code is used for a self-built raspberry pi based device that was employed at a synchrotron CT beamline during scans

DHT22.py is a header and should be in the same folder as the other two codes

P_controller_organized.py is the running version of the code

P_kill.py is used to end all active circutis and stop the whole temperature measurement operation
