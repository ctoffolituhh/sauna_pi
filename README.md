# sauna_pi

raspberry pi code for controlling a peltier element with a mosfet switch and a ds18b20 and a dht22 temperature sensors

the code is used in a self-built device that was employed at a synchrotron CT beamline 

DHT22.py is a header and should be in the same folder as the other code, which is the one you actually run
